**What I did**

- Fetch some book data from Google API (Used Unirest)
- Create Schema to store all those data into db. (Used MongoDB Atlas)
- Create view to enter the book name. (Using Get Http protocol)
- Fetch that particular data from DB entered by user (Book Title). If data is not prsesnt send a message to User "Book is not added to repository".
- Render particular book details if it prsesnt along with review.
